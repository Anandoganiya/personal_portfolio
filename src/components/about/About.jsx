            I am from Goa, complete BE in Computer Engineering from Goa University.
            I am passionate about all things web. I stress on the importance of having good structure and proper architecture while building applications. I like my code to be clean without any squiggly lines.
            When Iâ€™m not fiddling around with code, I tend to learn new things, watch series, play badminton, travelling and more.
